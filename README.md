Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The data set includes information about:

1. Customers who left within the last month — the column is called Churn
2. Services that each customer has signed up for — phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
3. Customer account information — how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
4. Demographic info about customers — gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
